 <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>1. I'm working towards being financially stable and free to live a good lifestyle, starting to have good habits, always putting my priorities first, getting good grades and accomplishing my long term goals.

2. I'm working towards these goals by following a plan that I already  have, working hard and applying discipline to everything I want to accomplish.

3. Three values that I consider most necessary for my success are patience, discipline and honesty, sometimes we can lack motivation because we might be tired but discipline make us keep going to be able to accomplish your goals regardless of what you have going on.

4. My short term goals that I hope I can accomplish is being able to buy my second car on my own, get all A's for this school year in all my classes and be able to graduate with honors next year.

5. The character traits and achievements I want to be known for is that I can accomplish everything I propose myself, doing my job in an excellent way because I like what I do and being humble.</p>
